# Hinglish

Hinglish is a code-mixed dialect where Hindi (or Urdu) is typed in the Roman script. In this project, we build NLP tools for the same and make Hinglish processing easier than ever.

## Data

We begin with with a list of 1.4 million tweets which we believe to have roughly 75-80% Hinglish tweets. Note that not all tweets are in this dialect, some are possible from other languages like Indonesian or Malaysian Bahasa.
